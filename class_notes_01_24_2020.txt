	1st part review (with assertThat(), hamcrest library)


	2nd part:
			Json Path: how to retrieve values from json file (as single variable or collection), and how to search in json response.


############################

	let's import swagger collection of ORDS to postman

	https://www.getpostman.com/collections/202f1655167201fe8efe - this is a postman collection of api requests. Here you can see what kind of request you may perform.


	{{baseUrl}} - it's a variable. and it can be changed in settings.

* optional (if you don't want to destroy mine:[)

	go to collection -> edit -> variables -> set url of your EC2 (where you have SQL Oracle DB and ORDS web service)
	instance. You can leave it default, in case you don't have your own ec2 with ORDS.

	ORDS swagger doc: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/vfom/ords-generated_api/1.0.0#/
